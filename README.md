# Conways Game Of Life

Created in 1970 by John Conway, *Game Of Life* is a zero-player computer classic that simulates cellular automaton. As a user you provide the game with a grid of cells, each that are either alive or dead, and the game will then utilize an algorithim to continuously simulate the next generation/state of the grid.
