# Conways Game Of Life

My recreation of the popular zero player game, Conway's Game Of Life. Built with ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜Š and reactjs with `rmwc` being my styling library of choice

### General Information

Created in 1970 by John Conway, *Game Of Life* is a zero-player computer classic that simulates cellular automaton. As a user you provide the game with a grid of cells, each that are either alive or dead, and the game will then utilize an algorithim to continuously simulate the next generation/state of the grid.

#### Rules of the Game

- If the cell is alive:
    - Remains alive with 2 or 3 neighbors
    - Dies in every other case

- If the cell is dead
    - Comes to life with exactly 3 neighbors
    - Remains dead in every other case

#### Algorithm

As this specific game isn't new, my main objective for the project was being able to both find and implement an algorithm that could simulate cellular automata. In creating the grid, I decided to utilize a 2d array with `1` indicating a cell is alive and `0` indicating a cell is dead. 

With this in mind I first had to determine the relationship between the given cell, `grid[x][y]` and its 8 neighbors, which can be described as such:

| Name          | Position        |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| top-left      | grid[x-1][y-1]  |
| top-center    | grid[x-1][y]    |
| top-right     | grid[x-1][y+1]  |
| left          | grid[x][y-1]    |
| right         | grid[x][y+1]    |
| bottom-left   | grid[x+1][y-1]  |
| bottom-center | grid[x+1][y]    |
| bottom-right  | grid[x+1][y+1]  |

From there the algorithm could calculate a total number, `sum`, from the values of its neighbors. Based on the rules of the game, if the cell was alive, `grid[x][y] === 1`, and `sum === 2 || sum === 3` then the cell would stay alive, keeping it's value at `1`. Also, if the cell was dead, `grid[x][y] === 0`, and `sum === 3` then the cell would come alive updating it's value from `0` to `1`. All other cases would result in `grid[x][y] = 0`. 

Given that the grid was represented by a 2d array, the algorithm utilized a nested for loop in order to access each cell within the grid to achieve it's goal of simulating cellular automata. 

```js
for(let x=0; x<numOfRows; x++){
    for(let y=0; y<numOfCols; y++){
        // rest of algorithm
    }
}
```

For my version of the *Game Of Life* I made the decision of considering any cell off the grid to be dead and therefore represented by a `0`.

#### Future Improvements

1. By utilizing a nested for loop the algorithm has an O(n^2) runtime which isn't ideal and will quickly slow down the runtime of the program as the size of the grid grows. Would like to explore utilizing different data structures and memoization to optimize the runtime

2. Adding feature to allow a user to manually step through the generations 

3. Adding feature to allow a user to adjust the size of the grid
